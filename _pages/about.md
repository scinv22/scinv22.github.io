I am an integrated M.Tech-PhD student at the [Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)](https://acsir.res.in/) and [Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI)](https://www.cmeri.res.in/), India. My research at the AI & IoT lab at CSIR-CMERI, under the guidance of [Dr. Rajesh P. Barnwal](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1284), focuses on unravelling the complexities of vision-based scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. Imagine a world where self-driving cars seamlessly navigate through bustling streets, perceiving and understanding their surroundings just like us. That's the challenge that excites me! My research journey began during my B.Tech project at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College and during my internship at IIT Kharagpur, where I explored distributed storage systems and coding theory.
