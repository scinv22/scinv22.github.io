I am an Integrated M.Tech-PhD student at the [Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)](https://acsir.res.in/) and [Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI)](https://www.cmeri.res.in/), India. I was born in [Baranagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baranagar) and grew up in [Kharagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharagpur), both of which are industrial cities. I am deeply passionate about physics, electronics, and computational science.

I am currently working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the AI & IoT lab at CSIR-CMERI under the supervision of [Dr. Rajesh P. Barnwal](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1284). I am interested in theoretical and applied research in the areas of multi-label classification, concept drifts, and hierarchical classification with specific applications in data streams. In addition, as part of my B.Tech project at [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in/) and during my internship at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), I briefly worked on distributed storage systems and coding theory.

The end goal of my doctoral research is the application of the novel ML algorithms, developed by me, to problems in the domains of autonomous vehicles, robotics, industry 5.0, and medical imaging. I am also interested in related problems such as explainability, ethics, bias, philosophy, etc. I am absolutely fascinated by the plethora of real-world solutions made possible through machine learning in the fields of applied sciences, engineering, linguistics, and social sciences.

<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
