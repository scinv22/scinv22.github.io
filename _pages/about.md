I am an integrated M.Tech-PhD student at the [Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)](https://acsir.res.in/) and [Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI)](https://www.cmeri.res.in/), India. I am currently working on computer vision for autonomous vehicles at the AI & IoT lab at CSIR-CMERI under the supervision of [Dr. Rajesh P. Barnwal](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1284). 
I am interested in theoretical and applied research in multi-label learning and visual reasoning for road scene understanding in autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, as part of my B.Tech project at [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in/) and during my internship at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), I briefly worked on distributed storage systems and coding theory.
