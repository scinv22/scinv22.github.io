I am an integrated M.Tech-PhD student at the [Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)](https://acsir.res.in/) and [Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI)](https://www.cmeri.res.in/), India. I was born in [Baranagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baranagar) and grew up in [Kharagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharagpur), both of which are industrial cities. I am deeply passionate about physics, electronics, and computational science.

I am currently working on computer vision for autonomous vehicles at the AI & IoT lab at CSIR-CMERI under the supervision of [Dr. Rajesh P. Barnwal](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1284). I am interested in theoretical and applied research in multi-label learning for road scene understanding and causal reasoning, with specific applications in real-time scenarios. Furthermore, as part of my B.Tech project at [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in/) and during my internship at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), I briefly worked on distributed storage systems and coding theory.

The goal of my doctoral research is to apply novel architectures, developed by me, to challenges in the domains of autonomous vehicles and robotics. I am also interested in related problems such as cognition, explainability, ethics, bias, philosophy, etc. I am absolutely fascinated by the plethora of real-world solutions made possible through machine learning in the fields of applied sciences, engineering, linguistics, and social sciences.
