I am an Integrated M.Tech-PhD student at the [Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)](https://acsir.res.in/) and [Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI)](https://www.cmeri.res.in/), India. I was born in [Baranagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baranagar) and grew up in [Kharagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharagpur), both of which are industrial cities. I am deeply passionate about physics, electronics, and computational science.

I am currently working on Computer Vision and Deep Learning at the AI & IoT lab at CSIR-CMERI under the supervision of [Dr. Rajesh P. Barnwal](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1284). I am interested in theoretical and applied research in the areas of multi-label learning, road scene understanding, concept drifts, and hierarchical classification with specific applications in real-time scenarios. In addition, as part of my B.Tech project at [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in/) and during my internship at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), I briefly worked on distributed storage systems and coding theory.

The goal of my doctoral research is the application of the novel methods, developed by me, to problems in the domains of autonomous vehicles and robotics. I am also interested in related problems such as explainability, ethics, bias, philosophy, etc. I am absolutely fascinated by the plethora of real-world solutions made possible through machine learning in the fields of applied sciences, engineering, linguistics, and social sciences.
